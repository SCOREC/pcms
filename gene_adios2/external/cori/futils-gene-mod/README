Instructions
============

1) Obtaining FUTILS
       The latest release of FUTILS is available from
       http://pleiades1.epfl.ch/~tmt/pub.

2) Quick installation
       The following steps can be used to build, test and
       install the FUTILS library:
         tar zxvf futils-x.x.tar.gz
         cd futils-x.x/src
         make
         make test
         make install
    The last step will install both the "g" (debug) and "O"
    (optimized) versions in your $HOME. To change the installation
    directory, replace the last step above with
         make PREFIX=<install directory> install

XGC-1 Installation Instructions
*******************************

Below are generic instructions for using an autoconf-generated configure 
script to install a software package. Here are some instructions specific 
to building the XGC-1 application code.

The configure script is used to discover the platform we are using, set some
common default options (many of which may be overwritten by the user), create
a target-specific build directory, and generate a Makefile within that build
directory.  In the most simple case, the user just executes "./configure" and
the script will do the rest.  After all the configuration work is complete, 
you should see a final message instructing you to cd to the build directory 
and run "make" to build the application code.

Most application codes such as XGC-1 can be built either with or without
certain options, such as MPI support or optimization flags.  These options 
are controlled by passing --enable or --disable flags to the configure script.
For example, you would say "./configure --disable-opt" to turn off the
compiler optimization flags and produce a debug build instead.  (Note: if you
merely wish to modify the default optimization flags that are being used, you
can override specific Makefile variables such as FCFLAGS on the "make" command
line.)  You would say "./configure --disable-mpi" to configure without MPI 
support.  A complete list of build options to be enabled or disabled can be
seen by running "./configure --help".

In addition, there are support library options specific to XGC-1 that the code
can be configured with or without.  These options include the DEGAS2 neutrals
package, the ADIOS I/O library, the pspline package of interpolation routines,
and the camtimers library.  A complete list of library options for XGC-1 can
be seen by running "./configure --help".  Each package can be included by giving
the option --with-PACKAGE to the configure script.  Typically, you would also
provide an installation directory where the package can be found.  For example,
"./configure --with-adios=$ADIOS_DIR" would configure XGC-1 with the ADIOS I/O
library and look for this package in $ADIOS_DIR.  (Note: For convenience, the
configure script has been constructed to configure with a given optional package
if the relevant installation directory environment variable has been defined.
So if ADIOS_DIR is set in your environment, the configure script automatically
configures XGC-1 with ADIOS support unless you give the option --without-adios. Similarly, if PETSC_DIR is set, the configuration includes PETSC support.)

The configure script is equipped with default settings for most of the 
production platforms that we use in the epsi project, such as Hopper and 
Edison at NERSC and Sith and Titan at ORNL.  By default, we always build with
optimizations on, with MPI support enabled, and with any 64bit-specific flags
needed.  For XGC-1, we configure by default with ADIOS, HDF5, NETCDF, CAMTIMERS
and PSPLINE as long as the installation directories are known.  The CAMTIMERS 
source code is in this repository, so it will always be configured and built 
unless you give the option --without-camtimers.  For the other packages, default
locations are provided for all known production platforms (e.g. Titan), so the
configure script will configure XGC-1 with these options also unless you
explicitly configure without them.  You can turn off these platform-specific 
defaults by running configure with the option --disable-cpes.  (Note: name is
a relic from the prior cpes project.)  You can also override specific settings
by changing the installation directory variable values in your environment.
This is often done through the use of "module" files that you load in order to
configure your environment.  For instance, on the Sith machine at ORNL, you can 
load the following modules to setup your environment for building the XGC-1
code with ADIOS support: hdf5/1.8.10, netcdf/4.1.3, and adios/1.4.1.

The configure script is automatically generated from an instructions file named 
configure.ac by running the command "autoconf".  It uses several project-
specific m4 macros defined in the files in the "acfiles" directory in this 
repository.  Similarly, the Makefile.in template that configure uses to create
a Makefile is generated from an instructions file named Makefile.am by running
the command "automake".  There are a few other related files like this that
must be generated and are completely dependent upon other files.  Whenever the
underlying files are modified, these dependent files should be regenerated.
Normally, this will be done by whomever is updating the m4 macro files in 
acfiles or the local instruction files.  However, if the generated files ever
get out of sync with the underlying instruction files or m4 macro files in the
repository, you can always run the command "autoreconf" to regenerate all of 
these files.

In summary, you should be able to configure and build XGC-1 on most of our 
"known" platforms with two simple steps:
1) Run "./configure"
2) Change to the build directory and run "./make"
Run "./configure --help" to see a list of configure options and environment 
variables you can use to modify the default configuration.  Load modules for 
pspline, hdf5, netcdf, adios, and papi as desired to alter the configuration.

Basic Installation
==================

Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.  The following
more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
instructions specific to this package.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
debugging `configure').

   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
cache files.

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

  6. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
     files again.

Compilers and Options
=====================

Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that the
`configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help' for
details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
reconfiguring for another architecture.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out automatically,
but needs to determine by the type of machine the package will run on.
Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the _same_
architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints a
message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:

     OS KERNEL-OS

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the machine type.

   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.

Sharing Defaults
================

If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share, you
can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives default
values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Defining Variables
==================

Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).

Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:

     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash

`configure' Invocation
======================

`configure' recognizes the following options to control how it operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.

// it) and the KSP is set up (preconditioned/factored) at construction. The RHS
// integrator is also bound at construction: its integration points fix the
// size of the cached sample buffer, which is allocated once and reused. Each
// Solve() call only fills that buffer, assembles a fresh RHS vector, and calls
// KSPSolve, reusing the cached factorization.
//
// Binding one RHS integrator per solver matches every current consumer (each
// builds M and the integrator together and reuses them in lockstep) and lets
// the sample buffer be sized exactly once. Reusing a factored M with a
// different integrator is intentionally not supported; if that need arises,
// add a setter that rebinds the integrator and resizes the buffer.
//
// Non-copyable and non-movable because it owns PETSc handles.

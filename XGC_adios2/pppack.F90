!     (tau(i), c(1,i), i=1,...,n) = abscissae and ordinates of the
!        data points. tau is assumed to be strictly increasing.
!     ibcbeg, ibcend = boundary condition indicators, and
!     c(2,1), c(2,n) = boundary condition information. specifically,
!        ibcbeg = 0  means no boundary condition at tau(1) is given.
!           in this case, the not-a-knot condition is used, i.e. the
!           jump in the third derivative across tau(2) is forced to
!           zero, thus the first and the second cubic polynomial pieces
!           are made to coincide.)
!        ibcbeg = 1  means that the slope at tau(1) is made to equal
!           c(2,1), supplied by input.
!        ibcbeg = 2  means that the second derivative at tau(1) is
!           made to equal c(2,1), supplied by input.
!        ibcend = 0, 1, or 2 has analogous meaning concerning the
